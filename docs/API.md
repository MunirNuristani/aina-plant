# API Reference

Every HTTP endpoint currently implemented by `backend/`. This is a
reference — "how do I call this endpoint" — not a narrative guide;
for setup, local development, and deeper walkthroughs (retries, the
device simulator, seeding), see `backend/README.md`.

**Versioning**: this document is checked into git alongside the code it
describes and must be updated in the same PR as any change to a route,
schema, or response shape — a stale example here is worse than none. It
reflects the API exactly as implemented as of the commit it's part of; if
an example stops matching reality, that's a bug in this file. Every
endpoint in this document lives under the `/api/v1/` prefix — there is no
unversioned surface.

## Conventions

### Base URL

Local development: `http://localhost:3000` (the port is configurable —
see `backend/README.md`'s "Environment variables"). There is no deployed
production base URL yet.

### Authentication

Two different authentication schemes exist, used by different kinds of
caller:

- **Device authentication** (`X-Device-Id` / `X-Device-Key` headers) —
  used by `POST /api/v1/readings`, the one endpoint an ESP32 device
  itself calls. See "Device authentication" below.
- **No authentication** — every other endpoint in this document
  (device registration/management, all of `/api/v1/plants/*`) currently
  requires no credentials at all. This is accurate as of this MVP, not an
  omission from this document: there is no admin-user auth layer built
  yet. Treat these as trusted-network/internal endpoints until one
  exists — don't expose them on a public, unauthenticated network.

#### Device authentication

Two headers, sent with every request to a device-authenticated endpoint:

```text
X-Device-Id: <device identifier>
X-Device-Key: <device credential, plaintext>
```

- `X-Device-Id` is the device's `identifier` (a human-chosen string set at
  registration) — **not** its `id` (a server-generated UUID used
  elsewhere, e.g. in the reading payload's `deviceId` field; see
  `POST /api/v1/readings` below for why these two are different values).
- `X-Device-Key` is the plaintext credential returned once, at
  registration or rotation (see `POST /api/v1/devices` and
  `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/rotate-credential`) — never stored or logged
  in plaintext server-side.

Failure modes: `401` if either header is missing or the credential is
wrong; `403` if the device exists and the credential is correct, but the
device is disabled.

### Error format

Every error response (any 4xx/5xx) has this shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid sensor reading payload",
    "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "details": [
      { "field": "rawMoisture", "message": "rawMoisture must be a number" }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `code` — a stable machine-readable string. One of `VALIDATION_ERROR`
  (400), `UNAUTHORIZED` (401), `FORBIDDEN` (403), `NOT_FOUND` (404),
  `CONFLICT` (409), or `INTERNAL_ERROR` (500, an unexpected/unhandled
  failure — see "Database failures" below).
- `message` — human-readable, safe to show a developer, not necessarily
  safe to show an end user verbatim.
- `requestId` — echoes the `X-Request-Id` response header (see
  `backend/README.md`'s "Request IDs"); include it when reporting a bug.
- `details` — present only on some errors. For validation failures
  (`VALIDATION_ERROR`), it's always an array of `{ field, message }`
  (`field` is `(root)` for a whole-body error, e.g. "at least one field
  must be provided"). For a small number of `CONFLICT` errors, it's a
  plain object with extra context instead (e.g.
  `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/assign`'s `{ currentPlantId }` — documented
  on that endpoint specifically).

### Database failures

An unhandled server-side failure (e.g. a database constraint violation
that isn't one of the specific, documented `409` cases) never leaks
internal detail to the client — it's logged server-side (with the full
error and a `requestId` for correlation) and the client gets a generic:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
    "message": "Internal server error",
    "requestId": "..."
  }
}
```

with HTTP status `500`.

## Health

### `GET /api/v1/health`

Liveness/readiness check — confirms the server is up and can reach
Postgres. No authentication.

#### Response

| Status | Condition                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Server up, database reachable.         |
| `503`  | Server up, database **not** reachable. |

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
```

```json
{ "status": "healthy", "database": "healthy", "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-..." }
```

A `503` response has the same shape with `"status"`/`"database"` both
`"unhealthy"` — it is **not** wrapped in the `error` envelope above; this
endpoint always returns a flat body regardless of status.

---

## Devices

Device registration and management. No authentication on any endpoint in
this section (see "Authentication" above).

### `POST /api/v1/devices`

Registers a new device and issues its credential. `FR-DEVICE-001`.

#### Request body

| Field                      | Type   | Required | Notes                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------ | :------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                     | string |    ✓     | 1–100 characters.                                 |
| `identifier`               | string |    ✓     | Must be unique across all devices.                |
| `firmwareVersion`          | string |          | Free text.                                        |
| `reportingIntervalSeconds` | number |          | Positive integer. Defaults to `900` (15 minutes). |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/devices \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "Balcony ESP32", "identifier": "esp32-balcony-01"}'
```

#### `201` response

The plaintext `credential` is returned **exactly once**, here; only its
hash is ever stored. There is no way to retrieve it again later — losing
it means rotating it (see `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/rotate-credential`).

```json
{
  "device": {
    "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "name": "Balcony ESP32",
    "identifier": "esp32-balcony-01",
    "enabled": true,
    "reportingIntervalSeconds": 900,
    "firmwareVersion": null,
    "lastSeenAt": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "plantId": null
  },
  "credential": "3f9a2b1c...64 hex characters..."
}
```

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                             |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Validation failure (see field table above).           |
| `409`  | `identifier` is already registered to another device. |

### `PATCH /api/v1/devices/:id`

Updates a device's editable configuration. All fields optional, but at
least one is required.

#### Request body

Any of: `name` (string, 1–100 chars), `firmwareVersion` (string, or
`null` to clear it), `reportingIntervalSeconds` (positive integer),
`enabled` (boolean).

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/v1/devices/3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"reportingIntervalSeconds": 300, "enabled": false}'
```

#### `200` response

The full updated device (same shape as `POST /api/v1/devices`'s `device`
field, no `credential`).

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Validation failure, or an empty body (`(root)`: "At least one field must be provided"). |
| `404`  | No device with that `id`.                                                               |

### `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/rotate-credential`

Issues a new credential for an existing device, invalidating the old one
immediately. Identity (`id`, `identifier`), plant assignment, and every
other field are untouched — only the credential changes. Use this instead
of deleting and re-registering a compromised device, which would mint a
new `id` and orphan its reading history's `deviceId` references.

No request body.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/devices/3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6/rotate-credential
```

#### `200` response

Same shape as `POST /api/v1/devices`'s response: the new plaintext
`credential`, returned exactly once, alongside the device.

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                 |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| `404`  | No device with that `id`. |

### `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/assign`

Assigns a device to a plant (device-centric URL — compare
`POST /api/v1/plants/:plantId/device` below, the same operation reached
from the plant's side). `FR-DEVICE-002`.

#### Request body

| Field      | Type    | Required | Notes                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------- | :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plantId`  | string  |    ✓     | The target plant's `id`.                                                                                                  |
| `reassign` | boolean |          | Default `false`. Required (`true`) to move a device off a **different** plant it's already assigned to — see `409` below. |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/devices/3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6/assign \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"plantId": "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"}'
```

#### `200` response

The full updated device, `plantId` now set.

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Validation failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `404`  | No device or no plant with the given ID.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `409`  | Device is disabled, **or** already assigned to a _different_ plant and `reassign` wasn't `true` — the response's `error.details` is `{ "currentPlantId": "..." }` in the latter case (not the usual field-error array). |

Reassigning a device never touches its already-recorded readings — each
reading's `plantId` was captured once at ingestion time, permanently
(see `POST /api/v1/readings` below).

### `POST /api/v1/devices/auth`

Verifies a device identifier + credential pair directly, without
submitting anything. Mainly useful for manual checks/tooling (e.g. the
seed script's printed curl example) — real device-facing endpoints use
the `X-Device-Id`/`X-Device-Key` header scheme instead (see "Device
authentication" above), not this endpoint.

#### Request body

`identifier` (string, required), `credential` (string, required).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/devices/auth \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"identifier": "esp32-balcony-01", "credential": "3f9a2b1c..."}'
```

#### `200` response

`{ "device": { ...same shape as POST /api/v1/devices's device field... } }`

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Validation failure (missing field).             |
| `401`  | Unknown identifier, or wrong credential.        |
| `403`  | Identifier/credential correct, device disabled. |

---

## Readings

### `POST /api/v1/readings`

How a device submits one sensor reading. **Device-authenticated** (see
"Device authentication" above). `FR-READING-001`, `FR-READING-002`.

#### Request body

| Field             | Type    | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readingId`       | string  |    ✓     | A UUID generated by the device. Doubles as an idempotency key — see "Retries" below.                                                               |
| `deviceId`        | string  |    ✓     | The device's `id` (UUID) — **not** its `identifier`. Must match the authenticated device (see "Device authentication" above for why these differ). |
| `recordedAt`      | string  |    ✓     | ISO 8601 UTC, when the device took the measurement.                                                                                                |
| `rawMoisture`     | integer |    ✓     | 0–4095 (the ESP32's 12-bit ADC range).                                                                                                             |

| `firmwareVersion` | string  |          | Semver-shaped, e.g. `"1.2.3"`.                                                                                                                     |
| `wifiRssi`        | integer |          | -100–0 (dBm).                                                                                                                                      |

#### Response

| Status | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `201`  | New reading stored. `status: "created"`.                                                                 |
| `200`  | Same `readingId` already stored for this device (idempotent retry, not an error). `status: "duplicate"`. |

Both share one body shape:

```json
{
  "readingId": "7c3e1a2b-4f5d-4a6e-9b8c-1d2e3f4a5b6c",
  "status": "created",
  "recordedAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "receivedAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:01.482Z"
}
```

`receivedAt` is always server-generated at ingestion time — any
client-supplied `receivedAt` is silently ignored. The gap between the two
timestamps tells you whether a reading arrived in real time or was
buffered and submitted late (e.g. after a Wi-Fi outage).

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Payload failed validation, or `deviceId` doesn't match the authenticated device.                                                            |
| `401`  | Missing/invalid `X-Device-Id`/`X-Device-Key`.                                                                                               |
| `403`  | Device disabled.                                                                                                                            |
| `409`  | Device isn't assigned to a plant, **or** `readingId` already belongs to a **different** device (the original is left untouched either way). |

### Retries and duplicates

`readingId` is device-generated specifically so a device that times out
waiting for a response can safely **resend the exact same `readingId`**
rather than generating a new one — the server recognizes the retry
(`200`, `status: "duplicate"`, same `readingId` echoed back, no second row
written) rather than creating a duplicate. This also holds when two
identical retries race each other concurrently. See
`backend/README.md`'s "Retries and duplicates" for more detail, and
`backend/scripts/simulate-device.ts` for a runnable example (`npm run
simulate -- --replay`).

### `GET /api/v1/readings/recent`

The most recent readings across **all** plants/devices — an admin/global
activity view, not scoped to one plant (contrast with
`GET /api/v1/plants/:plantId/readings` below).

#### Query parameters

| Param   | Type    | Default | Notes  |
| ------- | ------- | :-----: | ------ |
| `limit` | integer |  `50`   | 1–500. |

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/readings/recent?limit=10"
```

#### `200` response

Ordered newest-first by `receivedAt` (when the reading reached the
server — this view is "what has the pipeline been doing lately," not the
true measurement history; use the per-plant history endpoint below for
that):

```json
{
  "readings": [
    {
      "id": "7c3e1a2b-4f5d-4a6e-9b8c-1d2e3f4a5b6c",
      "deviceId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
      "plantId": "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9",
      "recordedAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
      "receivedAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:01.482Z",
      "rawMoisture": 2048,
      "moisturePercent": 45.5,

      "device": { "identifier": "esp32-balcony-01" },
      "plant": { "name": "Balcony Fern" }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | `limit` is not a positive integer ≤ 500. |

## Plants

### `POST /api/v1/plants`

### `GET /api/v1/plants`

Lists every plant.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants
```

#### `200` response

An array, `[]` if there are none. Each plant includes a `devices` array
of its currently **enabled** (actively reporting) devices only — a
disabled-but-still-assigned device is omitted here, though its `plantId`
foreign key is untouched (see `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/assign` above).
Device objects never include `credentialHash`.

```json
{
  "plants": [
    {
      "id": "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9",
      "name": "Balcony Fern",
      "commonName": null,
      "scientificName": null,
      "location": "Living room window",
      "notes": null,
      "potSize": null,
      "soilType": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "devices": [
        {
          "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
          "name": "Balcony ESP32",
          "identifier": "esp32-balcony-01",
          "enabled": true,
          "lastSeenAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:01.482Z",
          "reportingIntervalSeconds": 900,
          "firmwareVersion": "1.0.0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

No error responses beyond the generic `500` case.

### `GET /api/v1/plants/:plantId`

A single plant, by `id`. Same shape as one entry of the
`GET /api/v1/plants` array above (including the enabled-only `devices`
array), wrapped as `{ "plant": { ... } }`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9
```

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `404`  | No plant with that `id`. |

### `POST /api/v1/plants/:plantId/device`

Plant-centric mirror of `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/assign` above —
identical behavior and error cases, reached via the plant's URL instead
of the device's. `FR-DEVICE-002`.

#### Request body

`deviceId` (string, required, the device's `id`), `reassign` (boolean,
optional, default `false`).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9/device \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"deviceId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6"}'
```

#### `200` response

`{ "device": { ...full updated device... } }`

#### Errors

Identical to `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/assign` above (`400`, `404` for
either ID, `409` for disabled or unauthorized-reassignment).

### `GET /api/v1/plants/:plantId/readings/latest`

The single newest reading for a plant, by `recordedAt` (true measurement
time — a late-arriving buffered reading never shadows a genuinely more
recent one just because it happened to reach the server first).

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9/readings/latest
```

#### `200` response

`{ "reading": null }` if the plant has no readings yet (not a `404` — the
plant exists, it just has no data). Otherwise:

```json
{
  "reading": {
    "id": "7c3e1a2b-4f5d-4a6e-9b8c-1d2e3f4a5b6c",
    "deviceId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "plantId": "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9",
    "recordedAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "receivedAt": "2026-01-01T12:00:01.482Z",
    "rawMoisture": 2048,
    "moisturePercent": 45.5,
    "firmwareVersion": "1.0.0",
    "wifiRssi": -60
  }
}
```

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `404`  | No plant with that `id`. |

### `GET /api/v1/plants/:plantId/readings`

A plant's reading history, with optional time-range filtering. This is
the true measurement history (ordered/filterable by `recordedAt`) —
contrast with the global `GET /api/v1/readings/recent` above, which
orders by `receivedAt` instead.

#### Query parameters

| Param   | Type    | Default | Notes                                                                  |
| ------- | ------- | :-----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start` | string  |    —    | ISO 8601 UTC — inclusive lower bound on `recordedAt`.                  |
| `end`   | string  |    —    | ISO 8601 UTC — inclusive upper bound. `start` must not be after `end`. |
| `sort`  | string  |  `asc`  | `asc` (oldest first — for plotting left-to-right) or `desc`.           |
| `limit` | integer |  `100`  | 1–1000.                                                                |

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9/readings?start=2026-01-01T00:00:00Z&end=2026-01-02T00:00:00Z&sort=desc&limit=50"
```

#### `200` response

`{ "readings": [ ...same reading shape as "latest" above..., ... ] }` —
`[]` if none match.

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `400`  | Malformed `start`/`end`, `start` after `end`, or invalid `limit`/`sort`. |

## Care events

Manually logged care actions (currently just watering) for a plant, kept
so they can be compared against its moisture reading history.
`FR-CARE-001`–`FR-CARE-004`.

### `POST /api/v1/plants/:plantId/care-events`

#### Request body

| Field        | Type   | Required | Notes                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------ | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`       | string |    ✓     | Currently only `"WATERING"`.                                                                                                      |
| `occurredAt` | string |          | ISO 8601 UTC. Omit to mean "just now" — defaults to the current server time, so logging "I just watered this" needs no timestamp. |
| `amount`     | number |          | Must be ≥ 0 — a negative amount is rejected.                                                                                      |
| `unit`       | string |          | Free text, e.g. `"ml"`, `"oz"`, `"cups"`. Non-empty if provided.                                                                  |

| Status | Condition                                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | Missing/invalid `type`, or a negative `amount`. |
| `404`  | No plant with that `id`.                        |

### `GET /api/v1/plants/:plantId/care-events`

Lists a plant's care events, newest `occurredAt` first. Soft-deleted
events (see the `DELETE` endpoint below) are never included.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9/care-events
```

#### `200` response

`{ "careEvents": [ ...same shape as create's careEvent..., ... ] }` —
`[]` if none.

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `404`  | No plant with that `id`. |

### `PATCH /api/v1/plants/:plantId/care-events/:careEventId`

Updates a care event. All fields optional (same set as create above:
`type`, `occurredAt`, `amount`, `unit`, `notes`), but at least one is
required.

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9/care-events/b1c2d3e4-f5a6-4b7c-8d9e-0f1a2b3c4d5e \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"amount": 300, "notes": "topped up"}'
```

#### `200` response

`{ "careEvent": { ...full updated record... } }`

#### Errors

| Status | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `400`  | Validation failure, or an empty body.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `404`  | No care event with that ID **belonging to that plant** — a mismatched `plantId`/`careEventId` pair 404s the same as either ID not existing at all. Also 404s for an event that's already soft-deleted. |

### `DELETE /api/v1/plants/:plantId/care-events/:careEventId`

**Soft** deletes a care event — the row is kept (with `deletedAt` set),
never actually removed, so a plant's true watering history can't be
silently rewritten by deleting the evidence a comparison-against-moisture
was ever based on. It simply stops appearing in the `GET` list above (and
becomes a `404` target for further `PATCH`/`DELETE` calls, same as if it
never existed).

No request body.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plants/9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9/care-events/b1c2d3e4-f5a6-4b7c-8d9e-0f1a2b3c4d5e
```

#### `204` response

Empty body.
